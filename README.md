# elg.gg
https://elg.gg/

This is a rewrite of my personal website. Formerly a closed-source [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) site, now a redesigned open-source [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) site.  
The site itself doesn't do much, but all my servers are under elg.gg subdomains, so here I keep a homepage with some links on it.

The nginx site still lives at https://nginx.elg.gg/
